# Entries

## Background
A few months ago, I was starting to get into the idea of journalling. I wanted to write on an app rather than in a physical notebook so I took my search to the app store. However, I found that many of these journalling applications were bloated with unneeded features and had unpleasing interfaces. So instead of continuing my search, I thought of making my own web app as a fun side project that I would actually use. 

## Description
Entries is a journaling web app that focuses on simplicity and minimalism. Currently, it has basic CRUD functionality. Users can create, edit, and delete entries, and have the ability to group entries into different tags. In the future, I plan on bringing Entries to iOS as a mobile app.
